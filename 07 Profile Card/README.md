CHALLENGE 1:

Objective: Develop a responsive React application displaying user profiles.

    1. Component Creation: Build a reusable UserCard component.

    2. Dynamic Content: Ensure the component is dynamic by accepting user data through props.

    3. Layout: Implement a grid layout to display multiple user cards.

    Optional - Best Practice: To improve code readability and scalability, create a JSON data structure for user information and render the user cards by mapping through this data.

Technical Requirements:

    Styling: All styling must be done using Tailwind CSS.

    Responsiveness: The layout should be fully responsive across different screen sizes.
